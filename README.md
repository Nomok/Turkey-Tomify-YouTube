## Notes

-   This extension should be compatible with any Chromium based browser currently, as FireFox keeps giving me the business.

-   This extension was inspired by **[Steinful][Tweet]**'s Tweet and, obviously, **[MrBeastify][Website]**.

-   This extension is made purely for fun and is for obvious comedic purposes.
